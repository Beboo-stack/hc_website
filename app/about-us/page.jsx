                HC Furniture Mall revolutionized the shopping experience by
                transforming the concept of short-term exhibitions into a
                permanent, year-round destination. Bringing together all
                furniture and home accessories brands under one roof, the mall
                simplifies the furnishing and finishing process for customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea was realized after deep research and strategic
                planningâ€”focusing on location, tenant mix, mall circulation, and
                consumer behavior. Every detail was carefully executed to
                deliver a cozy, friendly, and inspiring atmosphere that enhances
                the customer&apos;s journey.
              </p>

                In July 2012, HC Furniture Mall launched at Mall of Arabia,
                occupying over 20,000 sqm across 3 floors. It brought together
                the top local and international furniture brands, offering a
                diverse range of products with varying styles, budgets, and
                tastes. With more than 55 stores and 200 brands, HC quickly
                became the largest and most successful furniture mall in the
                country â€” a true one-stop destination.
